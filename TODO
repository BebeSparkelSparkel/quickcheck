mention that 100 tests is an arbitrary number

Allow using unicode characters in Function instance for Char

To make a release:
* Run build-all script.
* Bump version number in cabal file, in source-repository link, and in test-suite stanza.
* Tag git repo.

Koen's old TODO (trimmed):
* add more callback functions
* implement pre-test callbacks (add these as a top-level flag)
* consider introducing special wrapper modules for certain extensions (such as callbacks)

More recently:
* Unify CoArbitrary and FunArbitrary?
* Make the testing loop more modular, and provide combinators for
  controlling when to stop testing, how to vary size, etc.
* Some general way of recording information inside a property.
* Add the 'infinite' combinator and use it to experiment with e.g.
  partial generators, sized-based generators.
* Reformat things---some lines are 120 characters long!
* Maybe split Property.Result into two parts, environment and result,
  so that we can include Property.Result in Test.Result.
* Perhaps make Gen (Rose a) a first-class thing (maybe for internal
  use only).
